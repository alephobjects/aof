\section{Overview}
Firewall.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Must be free software.
 \item The project must still be alive.
 \item Does it use a hardened kernel?
 \item How does it do security updates?
 \item Are there open security issues?
 \item Are there any CVEs?
 \item How are security issues handled?
 \item Is there a list of security issues?
 \item Does it have a wifi portal? (Should that be a separate box or in OpenWRT?)
 \item UTM - Unified Threat Management (e.g. snort, etc.)
 \item Load balancing between multiple upstreams (without BGP).
 \item Load balancing between dual local routers.
 \item Fail over to standby router (e.g. pfsync).
 \item "Anti-virus", SMTP, POP scans? Meh? (e.g. OpenBSD has greylist/tarpit.)
 \item Packet cleansing (e.g. tcp header randomization).
 \item Do we want DNS, DHCP, etc? Probably not?
 \item OpenVPN (built into router, or thru it?).
 \item Network graphing (MRTG, aguri, etc.)
 \item No broken "community" editions.
 \item Have mirrored server doing analysis?
 \item NAT options? cone, etc.
 \item Local system monitoring (e.g. system temp, hdd status, etc.)
 \item sshd
 \item GSM, pppd ?
 \item Two-factor authentication.
